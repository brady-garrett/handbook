# CE Core Competencies & Career Ladders

This page (WIP) is dedicated to how we think about recruiting talent, assessing performance and development, and promoting and advancing individuals.

The CE team is a single globally distributed team. There are 6 levels within the organization that are comprised of Customer Engineers, Senior Customer Engineers, Principal Customer Engineers, and Senior Principal Customer Engineers.

## Core Competencies

We think of the three core competencies that every CE must demonstrate in order to serve our customers and our business: leadership, business, and technology. Within each pillared competency are defined core behaviors that CEs perform. Each behavior has differing expectations depending on the leveling of the individual.

### Leadership

The leadership pillar embodies both the external and internal interpersonal relationships we build and nurture, the way in which we lead customers to value, and how we drive more value and better ways of doing business.

Within the leadership pillar there exists three core responsibility areas:

- Customer Interactions
- Leading to Outcomes
- Mentorship & Influence

### Business

The business pillar embodies the way in which we come to know and understand our customersâ€™ business and their needs. It also includes how our business serves these needs.

Within the business pillar there exists three core responsibility areas:

- Delivering Value
- Contextual Understanding
- Operational Excellence

### Technology

The technology pillar embodies the skills necessary to solve customer problems.

Within the technology pillar there exists three core responsibility areas:

- Technical Aptitude
- Product Knowledge
- Domain Subject Matter Expertise

## CEs Transitioning to CE Management

We want to support the career progession of CEs on the Customer Engineering team based on their individual career goals and aspirations. For those that desire to move from an individual contributor (IC) role to a management role, the CE Manager Interview Process for Internal CE Candidates outlines how teammates would go about assessing their readiness for and applying for new CE Manager roles that open up. The goal of this process is provide clear visibility into what expectations should be for career advancement into management within the CE team.
